## Research Interests

- [Internet of Everything](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=zh-CN&mauthors=label:internet_of_everything)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Dialogue Systems and Multimodal Interaction
- Semantic Understanding and Knowledge Graph Construction

My current research focuses on deep-level determination of harmful videos, aiming to address critical challenges in identifying and analyzing malicious content in real-world scenarios. My interests lie in developing advanced machine learning models to detect subtle patterns of harm—such as violence, misinformation, or inappropriate behavior—in video data, with a specific focus on applications in social media security and content governance. In essence, emerging technologies like AI-driven video analysis play a pivotal role in safeguarding digital environments. I am committed to leveraging my expertise to build more robust harmful content detection systems, contributing to a safer and healthier online society.
